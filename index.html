        Since starting my career in 2021 I have only followed one resource, roadmap.sh. It truly helped me go from 0 to having a job and changing the financial trajectory of my family.

        <p>I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to
            all the internees or junior developers.
            It's a great way to grow your skills and
            level up your career.

        <p>roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was
            fortunate to discover it during my university days in
            2018. Back then, it was a single repository with three
            images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has had
            on millions of lives since then.
